# What is Vite?

Vite: A fast, lightweight, and opinionated build tool for modern web development. Vite enables rapid development by leveraging native ES modules and providing an instant development server with hot module replacement.

# Why React ?

React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides a component-based architecture and a virtual DOM for efficient rendering and managing state. It simplifies the process of building complex UIs and enables reusable and modular code.

# Project Frontend Report:

- Framework: React.js
- Styling: Tailwind CSS

# Used npm packages:

1. react-router: A popular routing library for managing navigation and routing between different components in a React application.
2. react-router-dom: A companion package for React Router that provides DOM-specific routing components, such as `BrowserRouter` and `Link`, for client-side routing.
3. formik: A form management library for React that simplifies handling form state, validation, and submission.
4. yup: A JavaScript schema validation library used with Formik to define and enforce validation rules for form data.
5. axios: A widely-used HTTP client library for making asynchronous HTTP requests in JavaScript and Node.js.
6. tailwindcss: A highly customizable CSS framework that provides a comprehensive set of utility classes for building responsive and modern user interfaces.
7. autoprefixer: A CSS post-processing tool that automatically adds vendor prefixes to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
8. postcss: A versatile CSS post-processing tool that enables transformations and optimizations of CSS code.

# Implemented Features:

1. Routing: Utilized react-router and react-router-dom to handle routing and navigation between different components and pages in the application.
2. Form Management: Employed formik for simplified management of form state, validation, and submission.
3. Validation: Integrated yup with formik to define and enforce validation rules for form inputs and data.
4. HTTP Requests: Utilized axios for making asynchronous HTTP requests to interact with the backend API.
5. Styling: Leveraged tailwindcss for rapid and responsive styling using utility classes.
6. Build and Development: Utilized vite for fast development builds and instant development server with hot module replacement.

The frontend of the web application was developed using React.js, utilizing various npm packages to handle routing, form management, validation, HTTP requests, and styling. React Router enabled efficient navigation between components, while Formik and Yup simplified form management and validation. Axios facilitated communication with the backend API. Styling was accomplished using Tailwind CSS's utility classes, and the build process was handled by Vite for efficient development builds.
